This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Music Box

This application uses the Soundcloud API to retrieve songs and allows the user to play them.<br />
My goal with this project was to create a web application using React + Redux to control a global state and manage streamable media content reproduction. <br />
The application implements a custom web player, that can be operated from each individual song or with the global web controls 
- React
- Redux
- Functional components, hooks and custom hooks
- Infinite scroll
- Dark / Light themes
- Animations done with GSAP
- Style managed with scss

After learning a bit more and read from some experienced developers, I revisited the project to create a second version without Redux, managing state by props drilling, proper component hierarchy and using new custom hooks
